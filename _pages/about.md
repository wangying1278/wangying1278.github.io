Hi,guys! 
======
My name is Ying Wang, you can also call me Emma, which is my English name. I am a 26-year-old first-year Ph.D. student at Medical Bioinformatics, [School of Basic Medical Sciences](https://sbms.bjmu.edu.cn) of [Peking University Health ScienceCenter](https://www.bjmu.edu.cn/index.htm). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Dongyu Zhao](https://biomedinfo.bjmu.edu.cn/jsdw/0e418b3ea2a54e3f974f875a43a5d73a.htm). My research interests focus on machine learning-based virtual drug screening, as well as AI-aided protein design and drug development.

You can find my CV here: [Emma's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
